              The project starts off with a specific idea or concept from the get-go. These ideas are pitched at the

            Tech Start projects are themed around startups and entrepreneurship.

            Despite this theme, Tech Start projects are not about building real startups - instead, 
            we're focused on teaching skills, providing mentorship, and building projects that can boost 
            your portfolio and your career. That said, if you want to pursue your project as a real entrepreneurial
